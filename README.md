## 🛠️ About Me

I’m a **final-year B.Tech CSE student at LNCT Bhopal (2022-2026)** with a strong foundation in **Java, backend development, and system design**.

I specialize in **building scalable, production-ready backend systems** using **Java, Spring Boot, and distributed architectures** to solve real-world business problems efficiently and reliably.

My interests lie in **microservices design, real-time data processing, and clean architecture**, ensuring systems are robust, maintainable, and ready for scale.

Currently, I am actively seeking **SDE opportunities** where I can contribute to **designing and building scalable systems while continuing to grow as an engineer.**
